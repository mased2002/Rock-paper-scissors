Rock Paper Scissors Game

  ## Goals

The Rock Paper Scissors project aims to provide a fun and interactive implementation of the  game. The main goals of this project are:

1. Develop a working game that allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
2. Implement the game logic to determine the winner of each round based on the choices made.
3. Keep track of scores and determine the overall winner of the game.

## Skills Acquired

By working on this project, you can acquire the following skills:

1. Writing functions in JavaScript to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
2. Implementing conditional statements and logical operators to handle different game scenarios.
3. Generating random values to simulate the computer's choices.
4. Handling user input using prompts to collect and validate player selections.
5. Using loops to repeat actions, such as playing multiple rounds.
6. Working with arrays and string manipulation to store and display game data.

## Program Description

The Rock Paper Scissors program allows users to play the game against the computer. It consists of the following components:

1. getComputerChoice(): This function randomly selects the computer's choice from the options: rock, paper, or scissors.

2. round1(playerSelection, computerSelection): This function plays a single round of the game. It takes the player's selection and the computer's selection as parameters, compares them, and determines the winner of the round.

3. game(): This function manages the overall game. It prompts the player to enter their choice for each round, calls the `round1()` function to determine the result, and keeps track of the scores. It plays five rounds and displays the final scores and the overall winner at the end.

The Rock Paper Scissors project provides an opportunity to apply JavaScript programming concepts, enhance problem-solving skills, and create an enjoyable gaming experience for both the user and the computer opponent.

Have fun playing my Rock Paper Scissors game!
this my first task project in javascript and the experience was amazing.
